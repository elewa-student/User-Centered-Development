# User-Centered Portfolio

This website is a web portfolio.  It exists so employers and other developers can learn a little about me and see some of my work.

(This project is featured in [Scotch.io's Materialize tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/make-material-design-websites-with-the-materialize-css-framework).)

## User Stories


A user will come to my website to learn about me.  They can read my story and see what I'm working on now.  Users can also see a spread of my featured projects.  Each project sample can be expanded into a modal window.  Finally, a user can see my contact information or send me an email directly from this page.


In no particular order, a user can ...
* See my name and title
* Read about my experience
* Hover over a current job for more info
* Read my story
* Read my profile
* See my current jobs
* Click a project thumbnail to see more detail
* See thumbnails of my portfolio projects
* Send me an email
* See my contact info

## Story Dependencies

Here is a tree that orders the user stories by dependence.  ie. Before a user can click on a thumbnail, there must be able to see it.

This site has very simple and isolated user stories, these trees will get more interesting.

## Development Schedule

I'll develop the features in this order, respecting their dependencies (ie. not trying to make a modal before the thumbnail):
0. Get everything set up
1. Name & Title
2. Read story
3. Read profile
4. See current jobs
5. Expand jobs on hover
6. See project thumbnails
7. Expand projects in modal
8. Send me an email
9. See my contact
